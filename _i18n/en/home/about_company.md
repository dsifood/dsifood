# About Us

The history of the company began in 2011. Our experience in the food industry dates back to the early 1990s. Initially, we were involved in trade and consulting, and for the past few years, we have been independently designing and manufacturing food processing equipment. We are proud of our projects, a significant part of which are prototypical solutions that have no counterparts among other manufacturers.

We are the sole representative of <a href="https://www.heinrichgmbh.de/" target="_blank">Heinrich GmbH</a>, a manufacturer of many interesting and unusual solutions in the processing industry.

Our goal is continuous development; we want to learn in collaboration with our clients for mutual benefits.

The satisfaction of our clients is also our satisfaction.
